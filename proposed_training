1: LEARNING RATE
    epochs:5, range: 10**uniform(-6, -2) --> between 10^-3, 10^4 circa
2: WEIGHT DECAY
    epochs: 5, range: 10**uniform(-4, 2) ---> 0.001
3: GAMMA, SCHEDULER_STEP_SIZE, ENCODER SIZE(?)
    epochs: 250, gamma=[0.1, 0.2, 0.5], scheduler_step_size = [10, 20, 50] 9 different combinations with random lr, wd in very small ranges
4: complete training of model 1 through 8 with best hyperparameters
    epochs: 500?
